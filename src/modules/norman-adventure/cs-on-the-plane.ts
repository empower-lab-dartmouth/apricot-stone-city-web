Although he has called with them many times on Zoom, this is his first time visiting Apricot Stone City in person. He is very excited to connect with his friends from the company he has talked with online. Otherwise, he is not sure what to expect for his first visit in the country!`,

He watches the clouds and thinks about all of the tourist websites he read about Apricot Stone City, remembering the interesting architecture he saw in photos, and the ornamental detail worked into buildings which speaks to the pride and nationalism of the Armenian people. He is a bit of a scattered person, so he did his best to prepare for his trip this time He can't wait to see all of this, and the many sculptures scattered around the city he has heard about. As a graphic designer, he is sure that these artistic details will be his favorite sight-seeing endeavor. Sparked by inspiration, he pulls out a pen from his shirt pocket and takes the small paper napkin that came with his ginger ale and decides to put pen to paper. He is not sure what he is most inspired to do currently.`,
