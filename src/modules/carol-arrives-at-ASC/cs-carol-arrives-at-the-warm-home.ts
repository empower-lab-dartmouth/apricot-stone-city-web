At first everyone starts to introduce themselves: big uncle, uncle, aunt, cousins, twins Ani and Anna. One more name and Carol's head would spin around. Then they start enjoying delicious Armenian meal while Anoush's relatives continue to ask questions about Carol. Carol feels so welcomed and all negative emotions are gone. Hosts offer Carol to eat Armenian food. At first, she refuses, thinking that she will not like them, and at the same time she is feeling shy. She decides that it would be better to order Chinese food and secretly orders some, because it would be rude to do it in front of them. But the deliveryman says that he can't come because of the rain. Carol comes back and sits around the table. Anoush asks once more and she takes the offer.</b>",
